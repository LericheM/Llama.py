\\\MLH HACKRU 2019///

This is the repository for my HackRU 2019 hackathon project!
I have made a discord bot named LlamaMama!
This discord bot is a well-being bot that will alert users who have been playing games for too long to periodically stand up, drink water, and grab a healthy snack! (It might also send llama pics at some point TBD)
